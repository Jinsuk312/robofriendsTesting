Using my earlier created RoboFriends App to practice running different types of tests. I performed shallow snapshot testing of components that had state and props to. I also tested the reducers, actions and connected components. I used mock state/props/data in order to replicate a real life scenario, because testing with the real data would be time consuming/expensive for a company. Whereas using Unit Testing with Mockdata is possibly the cheapest solution for any company.
